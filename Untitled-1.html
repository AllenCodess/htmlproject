                    <p>Philly Cheesesteak is a sandwich made with super-thinly sliced ribeye steak, caramelized onion, 
                        and provolone cheese. That simple combination is the original classic as made popular on the East Coast. 
                        The Philly Cheesesteak has been modified on the West Coast to include green bell peppers and mushrooms, 
                        but a true “Philly” only has steak, onion, and cheese served over a roll.</p>
